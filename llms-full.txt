# Kigali Sim - Montreal Protocol Policy Simulation Tool
v=20251226

Kigali Sim is an open source web-based simulation engine for modeling substances, applications, and policies related to the Montreal Protocol and Kigali Amendment. See [llms.txt](llms.txt) (http://kigalisim.org/llms.txt) for an index of additional documentation and tutorials. It can model high global warming potential greenhouse gases such as HFCs and supports business-as-usual scenarios as well as policy interventions.

## Project Purpose
This tool provides simulation capabilities for:
- **Substance modeling**: HFCs, HCFCs, and alternative refrigerants with their Global Warming Potential (GWP) values
- **Application modeling**: Equipment types like domestic refrigeration, commercial refrigeration, residential AC, mobile AC
- **Policy simulation**: Import restrictions, manufacturing caps, substance replacements, recycling requirements
- **Business scenarios**: Manufacturing, imports, equipment lifecycles, service activities, energy consumption
- **Impact assessment**: Direct emissions calculations, energy consumption analysis, equipment population tracking

Kigali Sim supports both business-as-usual projections and policy intervention scenarios, making it useful for Kigali Amendment Implementation Plans (KIPs) and Montreal Protocol policy analysis.

## QubecTalk Domain Specific Language
Kigali Sim uses QubecTalk, a HyperTalk-inspired domain-specific language for defining simulations. QubecTalk programs are human-readable and use natural language constructs.

**Note**: In this documentation, pipe symbols (|) indicate command alternatives, not syntax. Chevrons (<) indicate optional values, curly braces ({) indicate required values. Neither are part of actual QubecTalk syntax.

**Comments**: Use `#` to add comments. Comments run to the end of the line and are ignored by the interpreter.

**Define vs Modify**: Use `define` in the `default` stanza to create new applications and substances for the business-as-usual scenario. Use `modify` in `policy` stanzas to change existing applications and substances defined in the default scenario.

### Program Structure
QubecTalk programs are organized into stanzas:

```
start about
  # Name: "Simulation Name"
  # Description: "Description"
  # Author: "Author Name"
end about

start default
  # Business as usual scenario
end default

start policy "Policy Name"
  # Policy modifications
end policy

start simulations
  # Simulation definitions
end simulations
```

The about stanza is optional.

### Core Language Features

#### Applications and Substances
- `define application "name"` - Creates equipment/application type
- `uses substance "name"` - Associates substance with application
- `equals X tCO2e / mt` - Sets Global Warming Potential in tCO2e units (t is tonnes)
- `equals X kgCO2e / kg` - Sets Global Warming Potential in kgCO2e units (kg is kilograms)
- `equals X kwh / unit` - Sets energy consumption per unit

#### Manufacturing and Trade
- `initial charge with {amount} for {stream}` - Sets substance per unit where amount is typically X kg / unit
- `enable {stream}` - Marks stream as enabled without setting values (required before recharge operations). By convention, place at top of substance definitions.
- `set {stream} to {amount} <during>` - Sets flow volumes
- `change {stream} by {amount} <during>` - Growth or decay rates where amount is often +X %

**Note**: Change operations clamp streams to 0 when reductions would go negative (e.g., reducing 5 kg by 10 kg). Downstream calculations use the actual amount removed, not the requested amount.

#### Equipment Lifecycle
- `retire {amount} <with replacement> <during>` - Equipment retirement rate, also called hazard rate or scrap rate (with replacement maintains equipment population)
- `recharge {population} with {volume} <during>` - Service recharging (population = equipment to recharge, volume = substance per unit)
- `set priorEquipment to {amount} <during>` - Pre-existing equipment.

#### Sales Assumptions (Bank Tracking)
The `assume` command provides control over sales carryover behavior:

- `assume no [stream] <during>` - Sets stream to 0 kg (zero all sales)
- `assume only recharge [stream] <during>` - Sets stream to 0 units (only recharge, no new equipment)
- `assume continued [stream] <during>` - No-op (sales continue from previous year, default behavior)

Streams supported: `domestic`, `import`, `sales`, `bank`

Examples:
```qubectalk
assume only recharge sales during years 2025 to onwards
assume no import during year 2030
assume continued domestic
assume only recharge bank during years 2 to 5
```

The `assume` command is particularly useful for bank (equipment) tracking scenarios where you want to model that sales should only cover recharge (servicing) needs rather than adding new equipment.

#### Policy Interventions
- `cap|floor stream to {amount} <displacing> <during>` - Manufacturing/import restrictions and minimums
- `replace {amount} of {stream} with "substance" <during>` - Substance transitions
- `recover {amount} with {amount} reuse <at {stage}> <during>` - Recycling with optional stage (eol or recharge) and duration

**Note**: When using units (of equipment) in cap, floor, and set commands, those limits apply after recharge calculations. So a cap of 100 units means 100 units on top of recharge for prior equipment.

**Units Tracking**: Percentage-based cap/floor operations preserve the last specified tracking mode (units vs kg) when triggered, enabling continued recharge calculations. Change and displacement operations always preserve current tracking mode.

#### Units System
Supports automatic unit conversion: kg, mt (metric tons), tCO2e (tons CO2 equivalent), kwh (kilowatt hours), units (equipment), years/months/days (time), % (percentages).

**Percentage Units**: Three percentage forms are available:
- `%` - Context-dependent percentage (prior year for cap/floor, current for set/change)
- `% prior year` - Explicit percentage of prior year's value
- `% current` or `% current year` - Explicit percentage of current year's value

The explicit forms (`% prior year` and `% current`) provide clearer intent and allow overriding default context-dependent behavior when needed.

#### Number formatting
Kigali Sim uses DecimalFormat number formatting (comma for thousands, period for decimal). Alternative formats like `123.456,7` generate suggestions for equivalent supported format `123,456.7`.

#### Advanced Features
- **Variables**: `define identifier as expression` and `get identifier` (scoped to enclosing start/end block)
- **Stream access**: `get {stream}` - access streams like `sales`, `equipment`, `age`, etc.
- **Unit conversions**: `get {stream} as {units}` like `get import of "substance" as mt` or `get age as years`
- **Age stream**: `get age as years` provides weighted average equipment age for age-dependent policies (read-only, computed)
- **Constraints**: `limit expression to [min,max]`, `limit expression to [,max]` (min of negative infinity), `limit expression to [min,]` (max of infinity)
- **Uncertainties**: `sample normally from mean of X std of Y`, `sample uniformly from X to Y`
- **Math expressions**: Basic arithmetic with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, parentheses
- **Logical operators**: `and`, `or`, `xor` for combining boolean expressions
- **Comparison operators**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` for conditions

### Time
Simulations may be run with years as the time unit where each time unit is a single step. Use of months or days is reserved for future use.

Commands can specify timing with `during year|years X to Y` or `during year X` for individual years.

Keywords `beginning` and `onwards` are available. For a simulation running from years 2025 to 2030, the following is valid: `during year|years 2025|beginning to 2030|onwards`.

Keywords `at` and `eol` are available for recycling commands. Use `at recharge` for recycling at service time and `at eol` for recycling at equipment retirement.

No duration means runs each year. Use `during year beginning` for first year only.

### Streams
Streams may be `domestic|import|export|sales|equipment|priorEquipment|bank|age`

- `domestic`: domestically produced and consumed
- `import`: imported either in vessel or initial charge
- `sales`: all consumption in country
- `priorEquipment`: equipment active coming into current year
- `equipment`: equipment active, either from prior or new
- `age`: weighted average equipment age (read-only, Advanced Editor only)

```qubectalk
set bank to 1000 units during year 1990         # Same as: set equipment to 1000 units
assume only recharge bank during years 2025 to onwards
```

#### Bank
The `bank` keyword is syntactic sugar for the `equipment` stream, provided for semantic clarity when modeling substance banks (total refrigerant in equipment). Using `bank` instead of `equipment` can make code more readable in banking scenarios:

#### Sales
Includes domestic, import, and recycling if active. Excludes export.

 - `set` / `change` sales impacts all consumption but recycling is limited by the recover command so domestic and import will be modified to satisfy command.
 - `cap` / `floor` place lower or upper limits on all consumption including recycling.

For virgin only, replace `sales` with individual commands on `domestic` and `import` to exclude secondary.

#### Age
The `age` stream tracks the weighted average age of equipment in the population. This is a computed, read-only stream that cannot be set by users:

- Age starts at 0 years for initial equipment
- Age increases by 1 year each simulation year
- With new equipment additions, age is the weighted average based on equipment quantities
- Usage: `get age as years` in formulas
- Example: `retire (get age as years) * 1 %` for age-dependent retirement
- **Advanced Editor only** - not available in Designer UI

**Note**: The `enable` command only works with `domestic`, `import`, and `export` streams. Streams must be enabled (either explicitly with `enable` or implicitly by setting non-zero values) before operations like `recharge` that require sales distribution calculations.

### Formatting
Use start/end keywords (curly braces not supported). Two spaces per tab recommended.

### Built-in Variables
Built-in variables: `yearAbsolute` (current year), `yearsElapsed` (years since start), plus similar for months/days

### Conditional Logic
Ternary operations using `if`/`else`/`endif`:
```
set domestic to 100 if testVar > 10 else 50 endif mt
```

Boolean expressions can be combined with `and`, `or`, `xor`:
```
set domestic to 70 if (testA or testB) and testC else 35 endif mt
```

### Probabilistic simulation
Multiple Monte Carlo trials can be specified like `simulate "test" using "policy" from years 1 to 10 across 100 trials`

### Policy Syntax
Policies use `then` to chain multiple interventions:
```
simulate "Combined Policy" 
  using "Import Ban"
  then "Domestic Permit"
  then "Efficiency Incentive"
from years 1 to 20
```

### Displacement
Changes in one substance can be offset by changes in another. For example:

 - `cap sales to 1400 mt displacing "R-404A" during years 1 to 5` offsets with another substance
 - `cap import to 1400 mt displacing "domestic" during years 1 to 5` offsets with another stream

This is available for `cap`, `floor`, and `recover`.

### Recycling Stages and Induction
The `recover` command supports specifying when recycling occurs and how much induced demand it creates:
- `recover {amount} with {amount} reuse` - Defaults to recycling at recharge (service) time with default induction behavior
- `recover {amount} with {amount} reuse with {amount} induction` - Explicit induction percentage (0-100%)
- `recover {amount} with {amount} reuse with default induction` - Uses default induction behavior based on specification type
- `recover {amount} with {amount} reuse at recharge` - Explicitly specifies recycling at service time
- `recover {amount} with {amount} reuse at eol` - Specifies recycling at end-of-life (retirement)

**Induction Control**: Induction determines how much recycled material adds to the market versus displaces virgin production:
- **Units-based specs**: Default 0% induction (displacement behavior) - recycling reduces virgin sales to maintain steady population
- **Non-units specs (kg/mt)**: Default 100% induction (induced demand behavior) - recycling adds on top of existing demand
- **Explicit specification**: Users can override defaults by specifying exact percentages (0-100%)

**100% Induction Recommendations**: 100% induction means recycled material does not displace virgin material — it adds to total supply. This is recommended when uncertain, as induction is a complex economic phenomenon. It can be paired with caps on virgin material (import, domestic) to ensure desired reductions alongside expanded recycling.

Examples:
```
recover 20 % with 80 % reuse at recharge              # Uses default: 0% for units, 100% for volume
recover 15 % with 75 % reuse with 50 % induction at eol   # Explicit 50% induction
recover 30 % with 95 % reuse with 100 % induction at eol  # Full induced demand
```

## Example QubecTalk Program
Note that the about stanza would not appear if using UI-compatible features only.

```
start about
  # Name: "HFC Refrigeration Analysis"
  # Description: "Domestic refrigeration HFC phasedown scenario"
end about

start default
  define application "dom refrig"
    uses substance "HFC-134a"
      enable domestic
      enable import
      equals 1430 kgCO2e / kg
      equals 100 kwh / unit
      
      initial charge with 0.12 kg / unit for domestic
      set domestic to 350000 kg during year 1
      change domestic by +5 % each year during years 1 to 5
      
      initial charge with 0.30 kg / unit for import
      set import to 90000 kg during year 1
      change import by +5 % each year during years 1 to 5
      
      retire 6.7 % each year
      recharge 10 % with 0.12 kg / unit
    end substance
  end application
end default

start policy "HFC Phasedown"
  modify application "dom refrig"
    modify substance "HFC-134a"
      cap domestic to 85% during years 3 to 5
      cap import to 85% during years 3 to 5
      recover 20 % with 80 % reuse with 25 % induction at eol during years 4 to 10
      replace 50% of domestic with "R-600a" during years 6 to onwards

      # Example: Age-dependent retirement (Advanced Editor only)
      # retire (get age as years) * 1 % each year during years 5 to onwards
    end substance

    uses substance "R-600a"
      equals 6 tCO2e / mt
      equals 95 kwh / unit
      initial charge with 0.05 kg / unit for domestic
    end substance
  end application
end policy

start simulations
  simulate "business as usual" from years 1 to 10
  simulate "with phasedown" using "HFC Phasedown" from years 1 to 10
end simulations
```

## Web Interface

Kigali Sim provides a web interface at https://kigalisim.org with two editing modes:
- **Basic Editor**: UI-based point-and-click interface for building simulations
- **Advanced Editor**: Code editor for writing QubecTalk directly

The Advanced Editor tab accepts QubecTalk code as input and can run probabilistic simulations not available in the Basic Editor. The Basic Editor can also generate QubecTalk code that can be further customized in the Advanced Editor.

### UI Editor Compatibility

When working with AI assistants, you may want to specify that only UI Editor compatible features should be used. The UI Editor supports a subset of QubecTalk features for ease of use:

**Supported in UI Editor:**
- Basic application and substance definitions
- Initial charges for domestic, import, export streams
- GWP values (`equals` with standard units: tCO2e/kgCO2e per unit/kg/mt)
- Energy consumption (`equals` with kwh per unit/kg/mt)
- Equipment retirement rates
- Stream operations: `set`, `change`, `cap`, `floor` commands
- Equipment recharging
- Policy modifications: `recycle`, `replace` commands
- Induction parameters: `with X % induction` in recover commands
- Time durations for commands
- Simple numeric values and standard units
- Single-substance policies (one substance per policy)
- Basic simulation scenarios (single policy chains)

**Not Supported in UI Editor (Advanced Editor Only):**
- **About stanza**: Metadata and descriptions (`start about`/`end about`)
- **Code expressions**: Variables (`define`/`get`), arithmetic, conditionals (`if`/`else`/`endif`), boolean/comparison operators (`and`, `or`, `xor`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), constraints (`limit`), and complex mathematical expressions
- **Probabilistic features**: Distributions (`sample normally`, `sample uniformly`) and Monte Carlo trials (`across X trials`)
- **Advanced streams**: `get {stream}`, unit conversions (`get {stream} as {units}`), and age stream (`get age as years`) for age-dependent policies
- **Multi-substance policies**: Policies affecting multiple substances simultaneously

**Example UI-Compatible Code:**
```
start default
  define application "domestic refrigeration"
    uses substance "HFC-134a"
      enable domestic
      enable import
      equals 1430 kgCO2e / kg
      equals 100 kwh / unit
      initial charge with 0.12 kg / unit for domestic
      set domestic to 350000 kg during year 1
      change domestic by +5 % each year during years 1 to 5
      retire 6.7 % each year
      recharge 10 % with 0.12 kg / unit
    end substance
  end application
end default

start policy "HFC Phasedown"
  modify application "domestic refrigeration"
    modify substance "HFC-134a"
      cap domestic to 85% during years 3 to 5
      recover 20 % with 80 % reuse at eol during years 4 to 10
    end substance
  end application
end policy

start simulations
  simulate "business as usual" from years 1 to 10
  simulate "with phasedown" using "HFC Phasedown" from years 1 to 10
end simulations
```

When requesting UI Editor compatible code, avoid variables, expressions, conditional logic, and probabilistic features.

## Command Line / JAR Engine

Kigali Sim is also available as a standalone executable JAR for running simulations from the command line. Download the pre-built JAR from https://kigalisim.org/kigalisim-fat.jar. A JRE (Java 21+) is required; [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) is a recommended source.

### Subcommands

```bash
# Show help
java -jar kigalisim-fat.jar --help

# Check version
java -jar kigalisim-fat.jar version

# Validate a QubecTalk file (checks syntax without running simulations)
java -jar kigalisim-fat.jar validate simulation.qbt

# Run a simulation and write results to CSV
java -jar kigalisim-fat.jar run simulation.qbt -o results.csv

# Run with multiple Monte Carlo replicates
java -jar kigalisim-fat.jar run simulation.qbt -o results.csv -r 100
```

The `run` subcommand accepts:
- `<file>` - Path to the QubecTalk simulation file (required, positional)
- `-o` / `--output` - Path to CSV output file (required)
- `-r` / `--replicates` - Number of times to run each scenario (default: 1)

The `validate` subcommand parses and interprets the file without executing simulations, useful for checking QubecTalk syntax before running.

**When to use replicates**: Use `-r 1` (the default) unless the simulation uses probabilistic features (`sample normally`, `sample uniformly`) or the user has explicitly requested Monte Carlo analysis. Multiple replicates only add value when randomness is present.

## Technical Implementation

- **Language**: JavaScript with ANTLR4 parser
- **Architecture**: Browser-based execution with no server-side computation
- **Output formats**: Visualizations, CSV export, emissions metrics
- **License**: BSD for code, CC-BY 4.0 for documentation

## Simulation Outputs

Kigali Sim generates:
- **Emissions projections**: Direct HFC/HCFC emissions in tCO2e
- **Equipment population**: Units in use over time
- **Consumption data**: Manufacturing and import volumes
- **Energy consumption**: Associated electricity usage
- **Policy impact**: Comparison between scenarios

### Montreal Protocol Attribution Convention

Under standard Montreal Protocol reporting, initial charge for imported equipment is typically attributed to the exporting country (equipment manufacturer), while recharge/servicing is attributed to the importing country (equipment operator). Domestically produced and consumed substances are attributed domestically. The trade supplement columns enable user-configurable attribution to support both standard convention and alternative accounting methodologies for international trade reporting.

### Bank Tracking Columns

The bank columns (bankKg, bankTCO2e, bankChangeKg, bankChangeTCO2e) represent the substance "bank" - the total amount of substance contained within the equipment population currently in service. This differs from consumption/sales columns which track substance flow volumes.

Bank calculations use initial charge values and GWP (Global Warming Potential) from the equals statement to convert equipment population (units) to substance volume (kg) and GHG impact (tCO2e). The change columns show the difference from the previous year, reflecting net increase or decrease in the substance bank.

## Variable Hazards

Constant % / year having recharge or retirement recommended for simple scripts but variable hazards can use age of equipment where `get age` yields average age of equipment:

```
uses substance "R-407C"
  enable import
  assume only recharge sales
  initial charge with 10 kg / unit for import
  equals 1774 kgCO2e / kg
  set priorEquipment to 100 units during year 2022
  retire (get age as years)^2 * 0.195% / year
  recharge (get age as years) * 0.109% with 10 kg / unit
end substance
```

Here leakage hazard rate linearly increases with age and retirement exponentially: 10 year average lifespan with 6% recharge during that lifetime.

## Limitations

This tool is unofficial and voluntary, designed to optionally inform Montreal Protocol policy discussions rather than replace official assessment processes.
