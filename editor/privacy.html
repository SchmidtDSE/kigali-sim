            <h2>Privacy</h2>
            This webpage respects your privacy and collects as little information as possible while
            still providing a positive user experience. Simulations built and run through the
            web-based IDE or the JAR engine are executed entirely on your device and are never
            transmitted to our servers. The only features that transmit simulation code over the
            internet are the <a href="#get-help">Get Help feature</a> and the
            <a href="#community-cloud-endpoint">Community Cloud Endpoint</a>, both of which are
            optional and described in detail below. By using the application, you agree to the
            following.

            <section class="minor">
                <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                This application records standard server access logs for security and stability
                reasons, including to prevent abuse. This is a common practice employed by many
                websites necessary for maintaining application function. This information includes:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        IP addresses which describe from which location and internet connection the
                        application is accessed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User agent strings which provide basic information about the device and
                        software ("browser") used to access the site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Timestamps indicating when the application was accessed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The pages and resources requested from our servers.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                These logs are maintained for security reasons and to ensure strong application
                performance but are anonymized within 7 days of collection. These anonymized
                statistics are maintained indefinitely as aggregated information for us to
                understand usage patterns in order to improve the service and maintain its
                performance. The anonymized data may also include error or bug reports. That said,
                no other personal identifying information is collected including email address,
                phone number, race, ethnicity, age, etc. Furthermore, please note that:

                <ul>
                    <li>Personally identifying information is never shared or sold.</li>
                    <li>Anonymized data do not include specific IP addresses.</li>
                    <li>
                        IP address is not retained past 7 days except for security / abuse
                        prevention purposes if potential unusual behavior is detected like in the
                        case of a large number of requests.
                    </li>
                    <li>No information we collect is used for advertising.</li>
                    <li>
                        Though we do not ask users their age to respect their privacy, this webpage
                        is intended for those 18 years and older.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Finally, if technical issues are encountered, error reports may be sent back to us.
                However, we do not intend to collect personally identifying information through that
                mechanism. IP addresses and simulation code / configuration are not retained through
                these reports. We do not capture simulation code is our server access logs. The only
                features that transmit simulation code to a remote server are the
                <a href="#get-help">Get Help feature</a> and the
                <a href="#community-cloud-endpoint">Community Cloud Endpoint</a>, both of which
                are optional. However, of these, only Get Help retains a copy of your simulation code
                (so that we can review it and respond). That said, Our cloud service providers' data
                handling practices are subject to their respective data processing addendums as
                described in the <a href="#subprocessors">Subprocessors</a> section below.

                <h3>Data Storage</h3>
                We save very limited data to your device and that data is not used to track you.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This application uses browser storage (localStorage) to save user preferences
                        such as whether to show the introductory text on subsequent visits. This data
                        is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to any servers. These
                        preferences are essential to support the core function of the application and
                        improve user experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are no non-essential cookies for this application and cookies are not
                        used for tracking, advertising, or analytics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some browsers may save temporary copies of our data and code for performance
                        reasons through a process called "caching" which can be controlled through
                        your browser settings. This application may use "cache-busters" to inform
                        your browser when new versions of application resources are available.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Local storage may be used, for example, to save the application on your
                        computer to support weak internet connections or offline usage. This may
                        also be used to save your work between sessions though that work is not sent
                        back to us without your explicit permission.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                By using this application, you agree to the transfer of standard server access logs
                and anonymized statistics as described above to be transferred to data centers based
                within the United States of America.

            <section class="minor">
                <h3>Security and Access</h3>
                We take security seriously. Communication between your device and our servers is
                encrypted with secure socket layer SSL. Access to non-anonymized access logs and
                the deployment configuration of the application is limited to the current
                maintainers of the project, automated systems we've constructed for running the
                application, and our subprocessors, and will not be disclosed except as required
                by law. As noted above, these access logs contain only IP addresses, timestamps,
                pages requested, and user agent strings; they do not contain simulation code.
                Note that anonymized data may be shared with project partners for the purposes of
                tracking project success and impact.

                The <a href="/guide/get_help.html">Get Help feature</a> will send a copy of your
                simulation to us along with a question or information about an issue. The purpose is
                for us to be able to better offer support during your use of the tool. Use of this
                feature is completely optional and it will not be used without your permission which

                Using the <a href="/guide/get_help.html">Get Help feature</a> will send your
                simulation code to us by email. United States-based servers within Amazon Web
                Services are used to send that message. Your simulation code, email address, and
                message body are retained for the purpose of providing you with support. This
                information is kept in confidence, access is limited to the team maintaining this
                tool and our subprocessors, and it will not be disclosed except as required by law.
                We ask that AWS removes any CloudWatch logs of this information within
                7 days, except that logs may be retained for longer in cases of potential abuse
                or malicious activity. For more information about AWS, see their

            <h2>Community Cloud Endpoint</h2>

            <p>
                The community cloud endpoint is an optional HTTP GET endpoint that allows
                QubecTalk simulations to be run on a remote server. It is intended for
                programmatic use and is typically invoked by AI assistants, scripts, or automated
                integrations. It is not used by the kigalisim.org web-based IDE or the Kigali Sim
                jar, which run all simulations locally on your device.
            </p>

            <p>
                When the endpoint is invoked, the QubecTalk simulation script submitted in the
                request is transmitted to and processed on a remote server. CloudWatch logging has
                been disabled for this endpoint; as a result, simulation code submitted in requests
                is not logged or retained by our servers. AWS may retain anonymous aggregate
                statistics such as invocation counts for billing and service monitoring purposes.
                For more information about AWS, see their
                <a
                    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/navigating-gdpr-compliance/aws-data-processing-addendum-dpa.html"
                    >Data Processing Addendum</a
                >.
            </p>

            <p>
                Users who are uncertain whether a tool or AI assistant they are using may invoke
                this endpoint are encouraged to review the tool's documentation or ask the
                assistant directly.
