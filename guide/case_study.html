            This tutorial provides a comprehensive case study demonstrating the full capabilities of 
            the Montreal Policy Simulator through a realistic scenario involving multiple substances, 
            applications, and policy interventions.

                <p>
                    In the <a href="/guide/interpreting_results.html">previous tutorial</a>, we
                    explored the visualization tools available in the Montreal Policy Simulator.
                    This final tutorial demonstrates the full capabilities of the system through
                    a comprehensive case study of ABC, a hypothetical medium-sized nation in the 
                    Asia Pacific region.
                </p>

                <p>
                    ABC consumes four substances in manufacturing and servicing: HFC-134a, R-410A, 
                    HFC-32, and R-404A. This tutorial specifically builds a simulation from scratch 
                    in code, as opposed to earlier tutorials using the UI-based editor. This case study 
                    will show how to model complex scenarios involving multiple substances, applications, 
                    and policy interventions working together to meet international goals under 
                    the Kigali Amendment.

                    Local manufacturing for domestic refrigeration is made up of a single manufacturer 
                    which accounts for 30,000 units per year are produced. There is no import for 
                    domestic refrigeration with HFC-134a. However, 10,000 units per year are imported 
                    spread proportionally across all other applications. This has a GWP of 1,430.0 tCO2e.

                <p>
                    Before considering policy interventions, we start by examining a business as 
                    usual case which does not involve any policy intervention.

                <h3>General</h3>
                <p>
                    We first can use national economic growth projections as well as industry 
                    growth projections to set overall trends.
                </p>

                <table>

                    In addition to these high level trends, there are some assumptions specific to 
                    individual substances. First, we anticipate 50% by weight of HFC initial charge 
                    for refrigeration equipment for alternatives. This leads to R-404A initial charges 
                    of 0.03 kg / unit for commercial refrigeration and 0.08 for domestic refrigeration.

                <p>That said, we will further refine this based off of additional substance-specific information.</p>

                <h3>Substance-specific</h3>
                <p>
                    All that said, let's assume we have some more specific information available about 
                    some substances. We will refine our earlier code to reflect.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First, for HFC-32, we expect growth in imports to grow by 100% linearly from 2025 
                    to 2035 without impacting R-410A across all applications. We will assume that this 
                    corresponds to an annual average percent increase of 7.18% per the CAGR formula. 
                    Also, unlike historic data, the simulation should expect 90% of the R-410A initial 
                    charge size. This means 0.90 kg / unit for residential AC and 4.50 kg / unit for 
                    commercial AC for imports only.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next, moving forward, we will assume that HFC consumption will be a bit higher than 
                    historic values. Specifically, we will assume a 20% increase over the historic averages 
                    in HFC consumption. This should be reflected in starting conditions used in the first 
                    year of simulation. This is used to represent HCFC component of baseline.

                <p>
                    Policy options can be modeled individually or in combination to demonstrate how 
                    different intervention strategies would result in compliance or non-compliance 
                    with Kigali Amendment targets. Each option addresses different aspects of the 
                    HFC consumption cycle. Specifically, we will consider manufacturing prohibition 
                    targeting new equipment production, import bans controlling market supply of 
                    HFC-based equipment, and enhanced recovery/recycling reducing service sector 
                    consumption from existing equipment stock through recharge.
                </p>

                <h3>New Equipment Prohibition</h3>
                <p>
                    Coming into effect in 2028, a full prohibition of domestic manufacturing of new 
                    HFC-134a and R-410A equipment. This leads manufacturing consumption of controlled 
                    substances to falls but servicing (recharge) continues for existing equipment. 
                    In this process, HFC-32 replaces the new units lost that would have otherwise 
                    been manufactured by R-410A. However, nothing replaces the new units which are 
                    lost from HFC-134a.

                    Coming into effect in 2029, this policy would place a full ban on imports for 
                    HFC equipment. Instead, imports would shift to alternatives in R-410A and R-404A. 
                    These would be based on the application compatibilities of each substance. That 
                    said, recharge would continue for existing equipment.

                    at recharge would go from 0% to 70% with 14% added each year. By adding code for this, 
                    we reduce recharge effectively to 30% of the original value once the policy is in full force.

                    Policies can be combined or "stacked" together in different scenarios. We will 
                    have the following simulations:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Business as Usual</strong> without any policies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manufacturing Prohibition</strong> with just that intervention alone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equipment Import Ban</strong> which includes just that policy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recovery and Recycling</strong> that only includes that program.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combined</strong> which uses all three policies considered at the same time.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Other policy combinations like manufacturing prohibition and equipment import ban 
                    may also be added later.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>
                    This comprehensive case study demonstrates the full capabilities of Kigali Sim 
                    in modeling complex, realistic scenarios. We have explored 
                    how to construct sophisticated models that include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Multiple substances across different applications</li>
                    <li>Realistic business-as-usual growth projections based on economic data</li>
                    <li>Targeted policy interventions including manufacturing bans, import restrictions, and recycling programs</li>
                    <li>Complex scenario analysis combining multiple policies</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The ABC case study shows how the simulator can support policy makers in evaluating 
                    different pathways to meet international goals under agreements like the 
                    Kigali Amendment. By modeling various combinations of policies, decision makers 
                    can understand the trade-offs and compounding effects between different intervention strategies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This marks the end of our tutorial series. You now have the knowledge and tools 
                    to create sophisticated simulations that can inform policy decisions and help 
                    address global environmental challenges. We encourage you to experiment with your 
                    own scenarios and explore the full potential of this powerful modeling platform.
