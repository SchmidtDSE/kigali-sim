# Kigali Sim tests

This directory contains unit tests for major components as well as integration tests (see `validate`) which provide "end to end" verification of bevhavior. Note that these tests use some scripts from the `examples` directory at the root of the repository. These tests can be run via `gradlew test` and are subject to style guidelines enforced via `gradlew checkstyleTest`.
