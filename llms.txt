## Key Capabilities

**Substance Modeling:** HFCs, HCFCs, and alternative refrigerants with Global Warming Potential (GWP) values and automatic unit conversions. See [Tutorial 2: Single Application and Substance](guide/md/tutorial_02.md), [Tutorial 3: Multiple Applications and Substances](guide/md/tutorial_03.md), and [Tutorial 9: Global Warming Potential](guide/md/tutorial_09.md).

**Application Modeling:** Equipment types including domestic refrigeration, commercial refrigeration, residential AC, mobile AC with lifecycle management. See [Tutorial 2: Single Application and Substance](guide/md/tutorial_02.md), [Tutorial 8: Equipment Units-Based Modeling](guide/md/tutorial_08.md), and [Tutorial 14: Bank-Based Modeling](guide/md/tutorial_14.md).

**Policy Simulation:** Import restrictions, manufacturing caps, substance phase-outs, recycling requirements, and regulatory scenario modeling. See [Tutorial 5: Simple Policies](guide/md/tutorial_05.md), [Tutorial 6: Recycling](guide/md/tutorial_06.md), and [Tutorial 17: Exports](guide/md/tutorial_17.md).

**Business Scenarios:** Manufacturing, imports, equipment lifecycles, service activities, energy consumption with probabilistic projections. See [Tutorial 4: Growth and Trade](guide/md/tutorial_04.md), [Tutorial 10: Equipment Energy Efficiency](guide/md/tutorial_10.md), [Tutorial 15: Variable Retirement and Servicing](guide/md/tutorial_15.md), and [Tutorial 16: Command Line and Monte Carlo](guide/md/tutorial_16.md).

**QubecTalk DSL:** Human-readable domain-specific language for simulation definition with natural language constructs and automated calculations. See [Tutorial 7: First Code](guide/md/tutorial_07.md), [Commands Reference](guide/md/qubectalk_commands.md), [Language Features Reference](guide/md/qubectalk_language_features.md), and [Stanzas Reference](guide/md/qubectalk_stanzas.md).

**Web Interface:** Browser-based tool with Basic (UI) and Advanced (code) editing modes, no server-side computation required. See [Tutorial 1: Introduction to Kigali Sim](guide/md/tutorial_01.md) and [Tutorial 2: Single Application and Substance](guide/md/tutorial_02.md).

**Local Execution:** Software can [downloaded as a jar](https://kigalisim.org/kigalisim-fat.jar) for local execution. See [Tutorial 16: Command Line and Monte Carlo](guide/md/tutorial_16.md).
