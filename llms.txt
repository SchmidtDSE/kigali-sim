## Key Capabilities

**Substance Modeling:** HFCs, HCFCs, and alternative refrigerants with Global Warming Potential (GWP) values and automatic unit conversions.

**Application Modeling:** Equipment types including domestic refrigeration, commercial refrigeration, residential AC, mobile AC with lifecycle management.

**Policy Simulation:** Import restrictions, manufacturing caps, substance phase-outs, recycling requirements, and regulatory scenario modeling.

**Business Scenarios:** Manufacturing, imports, equipment lifecycles, service activities, energy consumption with probabilistic projections.

**QubecTalk DSL:** Human-readable domain-specific language for simulation definition with natural language constructs and automated calculations.

**Web Interface:** Browser-based tool with Basic (UI) and Advanced (code) editing modes, no server-side computation required.

**Local Execution:** Software can [downloaded as a jar](https://kigalisim.org/kigalisim-fat.jar) for local execution.
