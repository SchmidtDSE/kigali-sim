## Purpose
This reusable toolkit models substances and equipment related to Montreal Protocol and the Kigali Amendment including those with a high global warming potential. 

**What it does**: This open source toolkit provides a simulation engine and related software for modeling substances, applications, and policies related to the Montreal Protocol. It focuses on hydrofluorocarbons and their alternatives within the Kigali Amendment. It supports a foundational business as usual simulation as well as "stacking" policy simulations on top of that baseline. It simulates emissions, energy, substance consumption, equipment populations, and trade longitudinally in service of research and policy activities like Kigali Amendment Implementation Plans (KIPs).

**How it does it**: This platform provides practical flexibility in stock and flow modeling. It supports user-defined structures in terms of applications like commercial refrigeration and substances like HFC-134a. It supports both UI-based and code-based editing within the QubecTalk domain specific language (DSL) where these two options interoperate between each other. For more information about the design of Kigali Sim including why we made QubecTalk, see [our paper draft](https://github.com/SchmidtDSE/kigali-sim/blob/main/paper/paper.md).

**Where it does it**: This portable execution can happen through a web-based bespoke IDE or outside the browser in the command line or within larger workflows. It is available running in WebAssembly (WASM) or on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It can also run with parallelization and conduct probabilistic simulation via Monte Carlo.

**Who it serves**: This scientific package supports researchers working on stock and flow modeling of these important substances as well as policy makers. With ongoing [Article 5](https://ozone.unep.org/treaties/montreal-protocol/articles/article-5-special-situation-developing-countries) nation usage, Kigali Sim was co-created in consultation with over a dozen countries and supporting organizations. See [our credits page](https://kigalisim.org/credits.html). We recognize that our community includes those of varied backgrounds in programming and [AI assistance is available](https://github.com/SchmidtDSE/kigali-sim?tab=readme-ov-file#llm-assistants).

<br>

## Quickstart
Make a simulation in 3 minutes! View our [quickstart video](https://vimeo.com/1116227339?share=copy&fl=sv&fe=ci). Prefer a text version? See our [initial written tutorial with animated gifs](https://kigalisim.org/guide/tutorial_02.html). Alternatively, go to https://kigalisim.org and then in the Designer tab:

 - Click "Add Application" to create a "Commerical Refrigeration" application
 - Click "Add Consumption" to create HFC-134a (click lookup for GHG equivalency, leave energy consumption at default, check domestic)
 - In your HFC-134a record, add a set record for 1 metric tonne (mt) sales in year 1.
 - Click "Add Simulation" and make "Business as Usual" from year 1 to 10.
 - Click the "Bank" radio button for total million units of equipment and see population increase over time.

Finally, go do the Editor tab and see the QubecTalk code you wrote:

```
start default

  define application "Commercial Refrigeration"
  
    uses substance "HFC-134a"
      enable domestic
      initial charge with 1 kg / unit for domestic
      initial charge with 0 kg / unit for import
      initial charge with 0 kg / unit for export
      equals 1430 kgCO2e / kg
      equals 1 kwh / unit
      set sales to 1 mt during year 1
      retire 5 % / year
    end substance
  
  end application

end default


start simulations

  simulate "Business as Usual"
  from years 1 to 10

end simulations
```

<br>

## Setup
All executions of simulations are private and local.

### Public hosted browser-based app
Requiring no new local software installation, use the public hosted version of the tool at https://kigalisim.org. Simulations are run locally on your own machine through WebAssembly and Kigali Sim will not send your simulation code / data to external machines without your permission. We simply provide public static file hosting (see [privacy](https://kigalisim.org/privacy.html)).

### Local jar file
For those who prefer the command-line interface, install Java (like through [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/installation)) and download the [latest Kigali Sim jar](https://kigalisim.org/kigalisim-fat.jar). Then, execute simulations with:

```
java -jar kigalisim-fat.jar run -o output.csv script.qta
```

Here, you may replace `script.qta` with the path to your QubecTalk script and `output.csv` with the path to where you would like to write results.

Note that this jar is also posted to GitHub Maven. 

### Docker
For those who prefer Docker, see `Dockerfile` which installs Java ([Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases)) and can be used to run simulations. For example, the following builds the image and runs `script.qta` with output to `output.csv` through the mounted `working` directory:

```
docker build -t kigalisim .
docker run -v $(pwd):/working kigalisim run -o output.csv script.qta
```

Note: Windows users should replace `$(pwd)` with `%cd%` for Command Prompt or `${PWD}` for PowerShell.

We also provide a Dev Container with additional tools for those looking to modify Kigali Sim or run a local version of the web-based editor. see `DEVELOPING.md`.

## Usage
Kigali Sim authors can choose to use a UI-based editor which does not require writing code or the QubecTalk domain-specific programming language.

### UI-based authoring
For users preferring a no-code point-and-click approach to authoring simulations, open the [UI-based editor](https://kigalisim.org/) and then review our [no-code hello world example](https://kigalisim.org/guide/tutorial_02.html). Alternatively, review an [example simulation](https://kigalisim.org/guide/tutorial_02.qta) made using the UI-based editor in order to explore the tools' capabilities.

### Code-based authoring
For those preferring to write code, review the [setup instructions](https://github.com/SchmidtDSE/kigali-sim?tab=readme-ov-file#setup) and then consider this example of a permitting system to replace a high global warming potential substance with one exhibiting a lower GWP. This demonstrates all of the basic building blocks of Kigali Sim model (applications, substances, policies, and simulations):

```
start default

  define application "Commercial Refrigeration"
  
    uses substance "HFC-134a"
      enable domestic
      initial charge with 1 kg / unit for domestic
      initial charge with 0 kg / unit for import
      initial charge with 0 kg / unit for export
      equals 1430 kgCO2e / kg
      equals 1 kwh / unit
      set sales to 1 mt during year 1
      retire 5 % / year
      recharge 5 % with 0.85 kg / unit
    end substance


    uses substance "R-600a"
      enable domestic
      initial charge with 1 kg / unit for domestic
      initial charge with 0 kg / unit for import
      initial charge with 0 kg / unit for export
      equals 3 kgCO2e / kg
      equals 1 kwh / unit
      set sales to 1 kg during year 1
      retire 5 % / year
      recharge 5 % with 0.85 kg / unit
    end substance
  
  end application

end default


start policy "Permit"

  modify application "Commercial Refrigeration"
  
    modify substance "HFC-134a"
      cap sales to 80 % displacing "R-600a" during years 3 to 10
    end substance
  
  end application

end policy


start simulations

  simulate "Business as Usual"
  from years 1 to 10


  simulate "With Permit"
    using "Permit"
  from years 1 to 10

end simulations
```

This can be run using the editor tab at https://kigalisim.org/ or locally via `java -jar kigalisim-fat.jar run -o output.csv script.qta` or similar.

### Additional resources
Developers can continue their work by going to the [User Guide](https://kigalisim.org/guide/) which had information on other features. See also the [formal QubecTalk language specification](https://kigalisim.org/guide/qubectalk.pdf).

### LLM assistants
