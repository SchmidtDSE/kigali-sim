# Montreal Protocol Policy Simulation Tool
Open source web-based tool and simulation engine capable of simulations related to substances, applications, and policies relevant to the Montreal Protocol. It may potentially be useful at the discretion of relevant stakeholders as an optional step in informing proposals.

<br>
<br>

## Purpose
This open source toolkit provides a simulation engine for modeling substances, applications, and policies related to the Montreal Protocol. It supports a foundational business as usual simulation and then supports "stacking" policy simulations on top of that baseline. These projections may optionally support activities such as Kigali Amendment Implementation Plans (KIPs). 

Though not intended to be comprehensive of all possible relevant modeling techniques, this tool provides access to both UI and code-based editing where the later can also conduct probabilistic projection. The QubecTalk domain specific language allows for high degree of customization and specificity with automated unit conversions. This includes calculation of direct emissions and energy consumption.

Unofficial and completely voluntary, this privacy-respecting simulation platform offers essential tools to optionally inform potential policy. Though informed by various perspectives from across the Montreal Protocol ecosystem of actors, this is not an official product of any agency, fund, or official international body and is, instead, a community project available to the public as an open source resource.

<br>

## Usage
To use the public hosted version of the tool:

1. Open the application in your web browser (https://mlf-policy-explorer.org).
2. Use either the Basic (UI-based) or Advanced (code-based) editor to define your simulation
3. Click Run to execute the simulation
4. View results in the visualization panel, which shows emissions metrics, consumption / sales data, and equipment population.

Data can also be downloaded through the export button shown in the results tab.

## Development

When developing on the tool, please try to ensure all automated checks pass, development standards are followed, and deployments only happen through the process described where possible (if releasing to the official release website).

### Automated checks

Various automated tests and checks are available to help those developing on the tool and engine.

In the engine (`cd engine`):

 - `./gradlew test`: Run unit tests for the engine.
 - `./gradlew checkstyleMain`: Lint production Java code built into WASM engine.
 - `./gradlew checkstyleTest`: Lint test Java code.

In the project root (tool):

 - `npx grunt`: Runs front-end unit tests and end-to-end integration tests.
 - `npx eslint ./js/*.js`: Lint production JavaScript.
 - `npx eslint ./test/*.js`: Lint test JavaScript.

### Development Standards
While contributing, please maintain existing styles defined in `.prettierrc` and `.eslintrc.yml`. Where ambiguous, follow [Google JavaScript / TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html) conventions. Unit tests through QUnit are encouraged but a specific test coverage target is not specified. Document code using JSDoc comments (required for all public members). Note that Replit AI was used to help with documentation and small trivial code changes but, for other purposes, please disclose use of generative AI before merging pull requests. We generally require that AI not used for architecture or large operations. At this time, we are not considering a change to TypeScript.

### Deployment
This project can be deployed using Github. Simply push your changes to the repository `deploy` branch. The deployment process is automated through GitHub Actions as defined in `.github/workflows/build.yaml`.
