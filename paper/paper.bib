               has been hailed as the most successful environmental treaty ever
               (
               https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/montreal-protocol-triumph-treaty
               ). Yet, although our main concern about ozone depletion is the
               subsequent increase in harmful solar UV radiation at the Earth's
               surface, no studies to date have demonstrated its effectiveness
               in that regard. Here we use long-term UV Index (UVI) data
               derived from high-quality UV spectroradiometer measurements to
               demonstrate its success in curbing increases in UV radiation.
               Without this landmark agreement, UVI values would have increased
               at mid-latitude locations by approximately 20\% between the
               early 1990s and today and would approximately quadruple at
               mid-latitudes by 2100. In contrast, an analysis of UVI data from
               multiple clean-air sites shows that maximum daily UVI values
               have remained essentially constant over the last ~20 years in
               all seasons, and may even have decreased slightly in the
               southern hemisphere, especially in Antarctica, where effects of
               ozone depletion were larger. Reconstructions of the UVI from
               total ozone data show evidence of increasing UVI levels in the
               1980s, but unfortunately, there are no high-quality UV
               measurements available prior to the early 1990s to confirm these
               increases with direct observations.",

               agreements impact our lives. If we bring all three together in a
               solid but flexible governance structure, then we are able to
               address those impacts and share more evenly their consequences
               across different nations. This is what the Montreal Protocol has
               done in its 30 years of life and will continue to do thanks to
               the recent Kigali Amendment. There are many lessons for
               diplomacy to be drawn from the recent negotiations, including
               the critical role of science. The most important lesson in
               reaching consensus is the injection of optimism, pride,
               ownership of the process, and building trust among all nations.
               The solid yet flexible foundation of the Montreal Protocol
               provided a firm grounding for the Kigali negotiations to
               experiment with the different negotiating techniques in a forum

  abstract  = "The consumption and emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are
               projected to increase substantially in the coming decades in
               response to regulation of ozone depleting gases under the
               Montreal Protocol. The projected increases result primarily from
               sustained growth in demand for refrigeration, air-conditioning
               (AC) and insulating foam products in developing countries
               assuming no new regulation of HFC consumption or emissions. New
               HFC scenarios are presented based on current
               hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) consumption in leading
               applications, patterns of replacements of HCFCs by HFCs in
               developed countries, and gross domestic product (GDP) growth.
               Global HFC emissions significantly exceed previous estimates
               after 2025 with developing country emissions as much as 800\%
               greater than in developed countries in 2050. Global HFC
               emissions in 2050 are equivalent to 9-19\% (CO(2)-eq. basis) of
               projected global CO(2) emissions in business-as-usual scenarios
               and contribute a radiative forcing equivalent to that from 6-13
               years of CO(2) emissions near 2050. This percentage increases to
               28-45\% compared with projected CO(2) emissions in a 450-ppm
               CO(2) stabilization scenario. In a hypothetical scenario based
               on a global cap followed by 4\% annual reductions in
               consumption, HFC radiative forcing is shown to peak and begin to
               decline before 2050.",
