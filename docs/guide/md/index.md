# Kigali Sim Guide

Hello! This website provides a series of tutorials and other resources intended to help you both get started and master [Kigali Sim](https://kigalisim.org). If you are new, consider beginning your journey with the [first tutorial](tutorial_01.md). Already a pro? See [reference materials](#reference).

**Prefer a video?** On external websites, we have a quick [5 minute introduction](https://youtu.be/gDfe7bG8Ppk) ([YouTube terms of service](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms&noapp=1)) or a [1 hour extended guided tutorial experience](https://vimeo.com/1159005072) ([Vimeo terms of service](https://vimeo.com/legal)).

## Tutorials

We think of the user's guide as a book and each tutorial like a chapter. We recommend that readers start here before using [reference materials](#reference).
