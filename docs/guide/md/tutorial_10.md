# Tutorial 10: Custom Policies with Code

Advanced policy modeling with induced demand and complex interactions.

## Under Construction

We are adding in induced demand modeling and other advanced policy features to Kigali Sim. This tutorial covering custom policies with code is currently under construction and will be available soon.

This tutorial will cover advanced QubecTalk techniques for modeling complex policy scenarios including:

- **Induced demand modeling**: How policy interventions can affect consumption patterns beyond direct restrictions
- **Complex policy interactions**: Understanding how multiple policies interact and potentially interfere with each other
- **Custom policy logic**: Using QubecTalk's advanced features to implement non-standard policy designs
- **Scenario sensitivity analysis**: Testing policy robustness under different assumptions

In the meantime, you can explore the other tutorials in this series to build familiarity with Kigali Sim's core modeling capabilities and QubecTalk programming language.
