        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <p>
          In the <a href="/guide/tutorial_11.html">previous tutorial</a>, we explored GWP but equipment energy efficiency also plays a crucial role in environmental impact. Energy-efficient equipment consumes less electricity, reducing both operational costs and indirect emissions from power generation. In this tutorial, we'll model an energy efficiency policy that gradually replaces high-energy equipment with low-energy alternatives. To narrow our focus to these effects, we'll examine how this transition can significantly reduce overall energy consumption (measured in kWh) while maintaining the same refrigerant type and cooling capacity. However, in practice, you can model both changes in substance and changes in equipment simultaneously.

        <h2>Setting Up the Business-as-Usual Scenario</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> In these feature specific tutorials, we will start from scratch each time. Click <strong>Save File</strong> to save your current work and then click <strong>New File</strong> to start a simulation.</p>

        <p>
          Let's create our baseline scenario with both high-energy and low-energy models of the same HFC-134a refrigeration equipment. We'll start with high-energy models dominating the market and minimal low-energy model adoption.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Create the Domestic Refrigeration application</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click <strong>Add Application</strong>.</li>
          <li>Name it "Domestic Refrigeration" without quotes.</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Add HFC-134a High Energy equipment model</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click <strong>Add Consumption</strong>.</li>
          <li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab:
            <ul>
              <li>Name it "HFC-134a" and use "Domestic Refrigeration" without quotes.</li>
              <li>Select Domestic Refrigeration as the <strong>Application</strong>.</li>
              <li>Set <strong>GWP</strong> to 1430 kgCO2e/kg.</li>
              <li>Set <strong>annual energy consumption</strong> to 500 kwh/unit, referring to annual amortized consumption.</li>
              <li>Enable <strong>domestic</strong> manufacture.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>On the <strong>Equipment</strong> tab:
            <ul>
              <li>Set <strong>equipment type</strong> as "high energy" without quotes.</li>
              <li>Set <strong>initial charge</strong> to 0.15 kg/unit for domestic manufacture.</li>
              <li>Set <strong>annual retirement</strong> to 5% each year.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>On the <strong>Servicing</strong> tab:
            <ul>
              <li>Set <strong>recharge</strong> to 10% with 0.15 kg/unit during all years.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>On the <strong>Set</strong> tab:
            <ul>
              <li>Set <strong>prior equipment</strong> to 1,000,000 units in year 2025.</li>
              <li>Set <strong>domestic</strong> manufacture to 20 mt in year 2025.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Add HFC-134a Low Energy equipment model</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click <strong>Add Consumption</strong></li>
          <li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab:
            <ul>
              <li>Name it "HFC-134a" and use "Domestic Refrigeration" without quotes.</li>
              <li>Set <strong>GWP</strong> to 1430 kgCO2e/kg.</li>
              <li>Set <strong>annual energy consumption</strong> to 350 kwh/unit, referring to annual amortized consumption.</li>
              <li>Enable <strong>domestic</strong> manufacture.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>On the <strong>Equipment</strong> tab:
            <ul>
              <li>Set <strong>equipment type</strong> as "low energy" without quotes.</li>
              <li>Set <strong>initial charge</strong> to 0.15 kg/unit for domestic manufacture.</li>
              <li>Set <strong>annual retirement</strong> to 5% each year.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>On the <strong>Servicing</strong> tab:
            <ul>
              <li>Set <strong>recharge</strong> to 10% with 0.15 kg/unit during all years.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>On the <strong>Set</strong> tab:
            <ul>
              <li>Set <strong>prior equipment</strong> to 1,000 units in year 2025.</li>
              <li>Set <strong>domestic</strong> manufacture to 10 mt in year 2025.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Create baseline simulation</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click <strong>Add Simulation</strong>.</li>
          <li>Name it "BAU" without quotes.</li>
          <li>Set duration from <strong>years 2025 to 2035</strong>.</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You should now see your baseline simulation running. We expect that the high-energy model is the dominant equipment with much higher consumption volumes than the low-energy alternative. To see this, select the <strong>Population</strong> and <strong>Equipment</strong> radio buttons (make sure <strong>All</strong> is selected in the equipment panel). With the specifics of the values we entered in given the production numbers and recharge demands, there is very slight decrease in high energy equipment over time and a gradual increase in low energy. However, overall population is increasing.</p>

      <section id="adding-efficiency-policy">
        <h2>Adding the Energy Efficiency Policy</h2>

        <p>
          Now let's create a policy that accelerates this replacement of high-energy equipment consumption with low-energy models. This will demonstrate how an equipment efficiency policy can reduce overall energy consumption without changing refrigerant type.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Create the efficiency policy</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click <strong>Add Policy</strong>.</li>
          <li>Name it "Energy Efficiency" without quotes.</li>
          <li>Select <strong>Domestic Refrigeration</strong> as the application.</li>
          <li>Select <strong>HFC-134a  - high energy</strong> as the substance.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Configure the replacement mechanism</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Go to the <strong>Replace</strong> tab within your HFC-134a High Energy policy configuration.</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Add Replacement</strong>.</li>
          <li>Set to replace 20% of <strong>all sales</strong>.</li>
          <li>Indiciate that it is to be replaced with <strong>HFC-134a - low energy</strong></li>
          <li>Set timing to <strong>starting in 2028 to onwards</strong></li>
          <li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to finish the policy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This policy will progressively reduce high-energy equipment consumption relative to the BAU. Specifically, we change 20% of high energy sales each year starting in 2028 with that demand being met by low-energy equipment instead. This accelerates that change we saw earlier. However, before we can see the effects, we need to make an additional simulation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="creating-the-simulation">
        <h2>Creating the Simulation</h2>

        <p>Next, let's create a simulation to compare the policy scenario with our business-as-usual baseline.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Click <strong>Add Simulation</strong>.</li>
          <li>Name it "Efficiency Policy" without quotes.</li>
          <li>Check the <strong>Energy Efficiency</strong> policy checkbox</li>
          <li>Set duration from <strong>years 2025 to 2035</strong></li>
          <li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Kigali Sim is now simulating both options but we need to configure the visualizations to do a comparison.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>

        <p>Let's examine how the efficiency policy affects both equipment adoption and energy consumption:</p>

        <p><strong>Equipment Comparison</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Select the <strong>Population</strong> radio button</li>
          <li>Ensure <strong>total</strong> and <strong>million units</strong> is selected</li>
          <li>Select <strong>Simulations</strong> radio</li>
          <li>Select <strong>All</strong> under the simulations list</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Compare the <strong>BAU</strong> and <strong>Efficiency Policy</strong> simulations and notice how overall number of units of equipment remains effectively the same. Next, let's consider the energy consumption</p>

        <p><strong>Energy Comparison</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep <strong>Population</strong> selected with <strong>total</strong></li>
          <li>Select <strong>GWh / year</strong> instead of units of equipment</li>
          <li>Ensure <strong>Simulations</strong> is selected with <strong>All</strong> to compare the two scenarios</li>
          <li>To better see the results, change <strong>Absolute Value</strong> to <strong>Relative to BAU</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Taken together, even though total equipment population and refrigerant consumption stay roughly constant, the overall kWh consumption drops substantially. This is because we're replacing equipment that consumes 500 kWh/year with units that consume only 350 kWh/year, a 30% efficiency improvement.
        </p>

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>You've successfully modeled an equipment energy efficiency policy! This tutorial demonstrated:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Equipment differentiation</strong>: How the same refrigerant can have different environmental impacts based on equipment efficiency</li>
          <li><strong>Energy-focused policies</strong>: Using "replace X% of sales with substance" to model efficiency transitions</li>
          <li><strong>Indirect impact reduction</strong>: How energy efficiency reduces environmental impact beyond direct refrigerant emissions</li>
          <li><strong>Market transformation</strong>: Modeling progressive adoption of efficient technologies relative to BAU</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Kigali Sim only models energy consumption and direct emissions from covered substances. However, you can use the <strong>Export Spreadsheet</strong> button to model with the country's energy mix to further explore impacts.</p>
