      <p>
        Kigali Sim represents the collective work of an international community made up of scientists / researchers, engineers, policy makers, and others helping to ensure both the success of this software and of the Montreal Protocol. To everyone part of Kigali Sim's journey, thank you for your time, your efforts, and your care. That in mind, this page offers our gratitude to everyone involved in this open source project.

        <h2>About the project</h2>

        <p>
          Started in 2024, Kigali Sim offers free and open source tools for modeling substances and equipment related to the Montreal Protocol with particular focus on the Kigali Amendment.
