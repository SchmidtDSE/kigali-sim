        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <p>
          Now that ABC Country has a solid business-as-usual baseline, let's explore policy interventions. In this tutorial, we'll add a sales permitting system that progressively reduces HFC-134a consumption in domestic refrigeration. However, that demand will not go away but, instead, will shift to the lower-GWP R-600a alternative.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="adding-r-600a-imports">
        <h2>Adding R-600a Imports</h2>

        <p>
          Before implementing our policy, let's first add import flows for R-600a to match the supply chain pattern we established for HFC-134a in Tutorial 4.
        </p>

        <p>For <strong>Domestic Refrigeration</strong>, modify your <strong>R-600a</strong> consumption record:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>General</strong> tab: <strong>Enable "Import"</strong> (in addition to existing manufacture)</li>
          <li><strong>Equipment</strong> tab: Add <strong>0.07 kg/unit for import</strong> (same as manufacture)</li>
          <li><strong>Set</strong> tab: Split your existing 2 mt by reducing <strong>domestic</strong> to 1 mt in year 2025 and adding <strong>import</strong> of 1 mt in year 2025.</li>
          <li><strong>Change</strong> tab: Ensure your selection uses <strong>all sales</strong> which, as a reminder, refers to all consumption (in our case, both domestic and imports).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This gives R-600a a similar import/domestic split as HFC-134a, making the displacement mechanism clearer when we implement the policy.</p>

        <h2>Adding the Sales Permitting Policy</h2>

        <p>Now let's create ABC's permitting system that targets HFC-134a in domestic refrigeration, where displaced demand will shift to R-600a.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Click <strong>Add Policy</strong>. Name it "Sales Permit". Then, select <strong>Domestic Refrigeration</strong> as the application and <strong>HFC-134a</strong> as the substance.</li>
          <li>Go to the <strong>Limit</strong> tab within your HFC-134a policy configuration and click <strong>Add Limit</strong>. Then, <strong>Cap</strong> all sales to 85% during <strong>years 2029 to 2034</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Displacing</strong> means that the demand lost from HFC-134a is then sent to another stream or substance. In this case, let's have it go to <strong>R-600a</strong> instead.</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Add Limit</strong> again. Set <strong>Cap</strong> on sales to 0 kg displacing R-600a during <strong>years 2035 to onwards</strong>. This will conclude the phase-out.</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to finish the policy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Creating the Permit Simulation</h2>

        <p>Now let's create a simulation to see how the permitting policy compares to business-as-usual.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Click <strong>Add Simulation</strong>.</li>
          <li>Name it "Permit"</li>
          <li>Check the <strong>Sales Permit</strong> policy checkbox</li>
          <li>Set duration from <strong>years 2025 to 2035</strong></li>
          <li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The simulation will now show both your original <strong>BAU</strong> and new <strong>Permit</strong> scenarios side by side.</p>

        <p id="tutorial-gif-5-3" class="tutorial-gif-holder">
          <img
            src="/guide/img/tutorial05_03.gif"
            alt="Animated gif showing how to add a sales permit simulation"

        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>

        <p>Let's observe how:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>HFC-134a consumption</strong> starts dropping in 2027 and goes to zero in 2035</li>
          <li><strong>R-600a consumption</strong> increases to compensate for the HFC-134a reduction</li>
          <li><strong>Emissions</strong> see a drop or a leveling off.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Specifically, under the <strong>Substances</strong> view with Permit selected under the <strong>Simulations</strong> radio button, you can see how displacement works: as HFC-134a is restricted, R-600a scales up proportionally. Since R-600a now has both domestic and import sources, the displaced demand gets distributed across both supply chains.
        </p>

        <p id="tutorial-gif-5-4" class="tutorial-gif-holder">
          <img
            src="/guide/img/tutorial05_04.gif"
            alt="Animated gif showing visualization configuration to observe HFC-134a and R-600a"
          />
        </p>

        <p>
          All that said, remember that without <strong>Attribute initial charge to importer</strong> checked, the visualizations show only the substance flows for servicing imported equipment, not their initial charge. Before finishing up, let's just quickly check that box once more and:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Select the <strong>Simulations</strong> radio button</li>
          <li>Select All simulations</li>
          <li>Select the <strong>Consumption</strong> radio button</li>
          <li>Use the <strong>configure custom</strong> link to combine imports and domestic production.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The lines almost perfectly overlap when <strong>Attribute initial charge to importer</strong> is checked but are a little further off without it, especially in 2035. This is because, as the import / domestic ratios (and their growth rates) are slightly different for R-600a and HFC-134a, the trade attribution causes the numbers to shift around a bit even though the total global-level picture is essentially balanced. That said, in any case, there are very minor differences expected due to servicing differences between equipment.
        </p>

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>You've successfully implemented ABC Country's first policy intervention! The sales permitting system demonstrates:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Targeted approach</strong>: Here we focused on the highest-impact substance (HFC-134a) first.</li>
          <li><strong>Progressive reduction</strong>: Gradual reduction then complete phase-out.</li>
          <li><strong>Market mechanisms</strong>: Displacement ensures demand shifts to R-600a rather than disappearing</li>
          <li><strong>Supply chain realism</strong>: R-600a displacement works across both domestic and import channels</li>
          <li><strong>Climate benefits</strong>: Emissions reduction through GWP-focused targeting (1,430 to 3 kgCO2e/kg)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The permitting system shows how a relatively simple policy can achieve significant impacts. This is also a very simple model but we are already incorporating socioeconomic projections and substance interactions.

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>

        <p>
          <a href="/guide/tutorial_06.html">Tutorial 6</a> will add a recovery and recycling program targeting the same HFC-134a domestic refrigeration sector. You'll learn how recycling policies complement demand-side restrictions by providing alternative supply sources, and explore how multiple policies work together to achieve comprehensive overall outcomes.
