      <p>
        This glossary defines key terms used throughout Kigali Sim documentation, tutorials, and the QubecTalk domain-specific language.
      </p>

      <section class="major" id="terms">
        <h2>Terms</h2>

        <dl>
          <dt>Age</dt>
          <dd>A computed, read-only stream that tracks the weighted average age of equipment in the population. Age starts at 0 years for initial equipment and increases by 1 year each simulation year. Usage: <code>get age as years</code> in formulas. Typically used for age-dependent policies like variable retirement rates.</dd>

          <dt>Application</dt>
          <dd>Type of equipment or application that uses substances, such as domestic refrigeration, commercial refrigeration, residential AC, or mobile AC. Defined using <code>define application "name"</code> in QubecTalk.</dd>

          <dt>Article 5</dt>
          <dd>Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol addresses the special situation of developing countries. Developing country has a specific definition in the treaty.</dd>

          <dt>Bank</dt>
          <dd>The total amount of substance (not yet released to the atmosphere) in (in-service) equipment contained within the country. Also called the reservoir. Same as the equipment stream when modeling substance banks.</dd>

          <dt>Bank-Based Modeling</dt>
          <dd>A modeling approach where you specify the substance bank (reservoir) levels over time and Kigali Sim calculates the required sales given servicing and retirement to achieve those bank levels. Also called reservoir-based modeling.</dd>

          <dt>Business as Usual</dt>
          <dd>The baseline scenario defined in the default stanza that projects future outcomes without new policy interventions. Often abbreviated as BAU.</dd>

          <dt>Cap</dt>
          <dd>A policy command that limits consumption to specified levels, optionally with displacement to alternative substances. Syntax: <code>cap streamName to amount [displacing "substanceName"] during years startYear to endYear</code>.</dd>

          <dt>CFC</dt>
          <dd>Chlorofluorocarbon. Ozone-depleting substances that were largely phased out under the Montreal Protocol.</dd>

          <dt>Change</dt>
          <dd>A command that applies growth or decline rates to consumption over time. Syntax: <code>change streamName by percentage % / year during years startYear to endYear</code>.</dd>

          <dt>Code-based Editor</dt>
          <dd>Code editor interface for writing QubecTalk directly, supporting features not available in the Basic Editor such as variables, mathematical expressions, conditional logic, probabilistic sampling, and Monte Carlo simulations.</dd>

          <dt>Command</dt>
          <dd>Executable statements within QubecTalk stanzas that take an action such as defining substance properties, setting values, and configuring policies. Examples include <code>set</code>, <code>cap</code>, <code>recover</code>, and <code>replace</code>.</dd>

          <dt>Consumption</dt>
          <dd>The actual use of substance within a country. In Montreal Protocol trade attribution, refers to the net supply of controlled substances into a country's economy such that imported pre-charged equipment does not count towards consumption but exported equipment initial charge does.</dd>

          <dt>Displacement</dt>
          <dd>The mechanism by which changes in one substance or stream are offset by changes in another. For example, <code>cap sales to 1400 mt displacing "R-404A"</code> offsets reduction with another substance. Available for cap, floor, and recover commands.</dd>

          <dt>Domestic</dt>
          <dd>A stream representing domestic manufacturing or production of substances within a country that are also used in the country. Can be used to model domestic assembly as well if the same value is subtracted from imports.</dd>

          <dt>Domain Specific Language (DSL)</dt>
          <dd>A programming language specialized for a particular application domain. QubecTalk is a DSL designed specifically for Montreal Protocol policy simulation.</dd>

          <dt>Emissions</dt>
          <dd>Direct release of substances to the atmosphere, measured in tCO2e (tons CO2 equivalent). Sources include emissions during useful life (typically approximated by recharge emissions looking at leakage calculated at servicing), end-of-life emissions (those encountered at disposal or otherwise after retirement), and initial charge emissions.</dd>
          
          <dt>Emissions, direct</dt>
          <dd>The emissions caused directly by the activity of interest. Kigali Sim models these direct emissions which is to say the actual controlled substances. In contrast, it does not model indirect emissions like CO2e from energy consumption though its metrics can support calculation of indirect emissions.</dd>

          <dt>Emissions, end of life</dt>
          <dd>End of life emissions or EOL emissions refer to the leakage of substance from equipment after that equipment is no longer in service. This is typically reported at the time the equipment leaves active use as the curve describing the precise emissions over time after retirement or "scrap" may be variable or unknown.</dd>

          <dt>Emissions, indirect</dt>
          <dd>Emissions caused by activities which support the activity of interest. For Kigali Sim, these indirect emissions are typically CO2e from energy production. Users may model this by exporting data from Kigali Sim and combining it with energy mix information.</dd>

          <dt>Emissions, initial charge</dt>
          <dd>Emissions encountered when first filling equipment with refrigerant. Typically these volumes are very small relative to emissions encountered during the lifetime or end of life.</dd>

          <dt>Emissions, recharge</dt>
          <dd>Recharge emissions approximate emissions during the active lifetime of equipment, excluding end of life. This is specifically the amount of substance reported as emitted as calculated at time of servicing. This approximation is used as the shape of the curve describing precise emissions over time between manufacturing and servicing, between servicings themselves, or between servicing and end of life, is typically unknown or variable.</dd>

          <dt>Enable</dt>
          <dd>A command that activates specific supply streams (domestic, import, export) for a substance. Required before operations like recharge that require sales distribution calculations. Syntax: <code>enable streamName</code>.</dd>

          <dt>End-of-Life (EOL)</dt>
          <dd>The stage when equipment is retired or scrapped (becomes no longer in service). Used in recycling commands to specify when recovery occurs: <code>at eol</code> for recycling during retirement versus <code>at recharge</code> for recycling during servicing.</dd>

          <dt>Energy Consumption</dt>

          <dd>A stream representing substances or equipment exported from a country to other countries.</dd>

          <dt>Floor</dt>
          <dd>A policy command that sets minimums like for consumption. Syntax: <code>floor streamName to amount during years startYear to endYear</code>.</dd>

          <dt>Get</dt>
          <dd>A command that retrieves values from streams for use in expressions and calculations. Supports unit conversion and cross-substance access. Syntax: <code>get streamName [of "substanceName"] [as units]</code>.</dd>

          <dt>Global Warming Potential (GWP)</dt>
          <dd>A measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere compared to carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. For example, HFC-134a has a GWP of 1,430, meaning it is 1,430 times more potent than CO2. Defined using <code>equals gwpValue tCO2e / mt</code> or <code>equals gwpValue kgCO2e / kg</code>.</dd>

          <dt>Hazard Rate</dt>

          <dd>A stream representing all consumption within the simulated country in the current year. In other words, the total new substance entering the market. For all simulations, this is the combination of both domestic manufacturing and imports. However, this includes recycling if active. Set / change sales impacts all consumption where, as recycling is limited by the recover command, domestic and import will be modified to satisfy a set or change after taking the unchanged recycling capacity into account.
