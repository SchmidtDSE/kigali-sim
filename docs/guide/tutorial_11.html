        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <p>
          Global Warming Potential (GWP) values represent how much a substance contributes to climate change compared to CO2. Different refrigerants have vastly different climate impacts - for example, HFC-134a has a GWP of 1,430 while R-600a (isobutane) has a GWP of only 3. This means that each kilogram of HFC-134a has the same climate impact as 477 kilograms of R-600a!
        </p>

        <p>
          In this tutorial, we'll model a refrigerant substitution policy that gradually replaces HFC-134a with R-600a in domestic refrigeration. You'll see how this transition can dramatically reduce overall climate impact (measured in tCO2e) even when total refrigerant consumption remains similar.
        </p>

      <section id="setup-business-as-usual">
        <h2>Setting Up the Business-as-Usual Scenario</h2>

        <p>
          First, let's create our baseline scenario with both HFC-134a and R-600a refrigerants in domestic refrigeration. We'll start with HFC-134a as the dominant refrigerant and minimal R-600a consumption.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Create the Domestic Refrigeration application</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click <strong>Add Application</strong></li>
          <li>Name it "Domestic Refrigeration"</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Add HFC-134a substance</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>In your Domestic Refrigeration application, click <strong>Add Substance</strong></li>
          <li>Name it "HFC-134a"</li>
          <li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Enable "Domestic Manufacture"</strong></li>
              <li>Set <strong>GWP to 1430 tCO2e/kg</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>On the <strong>Equipment</strong> tab:
            <ul>
              <li>Set <strong>Initial charge to 0.15 kg/unit for domestic manufacture</strong></li>
              <li>Set <strong>Retirement rate to 5% each year</strong></li>
              <li>Set <strong>Recharge to 10% with 0.15 kg/unit each year</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>On the <strong>Set</strong> tab:
            <ul>
              <li>Set <strong>Prior equipment to 1,000,000 units in year 2025</strong></li>
              <li>Set <strong>Domestic manufacture to 20 mt in year 2025</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Add R-600a substance</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Still in your Domestic Refrigeration application, click <strong>Add Substance</strong></li>
          <li>Name it "R-600a"</li>
          <li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Enable "Domestic Manufacture"</strong></li>
              <li>Set <strong>GWP to 3 tCO2e/kg</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>On the <strong>Equipment</strong> tab:
            <ul>
              <li>Set <strong>Initial charge to 0.07 kg/unit for domestic manufacture</strong></li>
              <li>Set <strong>Retirement rate to 5% each year</strong></li>
              <li>Set <strong>Recharge to 10% with 0.07 kg/unit each year</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>On the <strong>Set</strong> tab:
            <ul>
              <li>Set <strong>Prior equipment to 50,000 units in year 2025</strong></li>
              <li>Set <strong>Domestic manufacture to 1 mt in year 2025</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Create baseline simulation</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click <strong>Add Simulation</strong></li>
          <li>Name it "BAU"</li>
          <li>Set duration from <strong>years 2025 to 2035</strong></li>
          <li>Leave all policies unchecked (this is our business-as-usual baseline)</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>You should now see your baseline simulation running, showing HFC-134a as the dominant refrigerant with much higher consumption volumes than R-600a.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="adding-substitution-policy">
        <h2>Adding the GWP Reduction Policy</h2>

        <p>
          Now let's create a policy that gradually replaces HFC-134a consumption with R-600a. This will demonstrate how a substance substitution policy can reduce overall climate impact.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Create the substitution policy</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click <strong>Add Policy</strong></li>
          <li>Name it "GWP Reduction"</li>
          <li>Select <strong>Domestic Refrigeration</strong> as the application</li>
          <li>Select <strong>HFC-134a</strong> as the substance</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Configure the replacement mechanism</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Go to the <strong>Replace</strong> tab within your HFC-134a policy configuration</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Add Replace</strong></li>
          <li>Set <strong>Replace 10% of sales with R-600a</strong></li>
          <li>Set timing to <strong>each year during years 2028 to onwards</strong></li>
          <li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to finish the policy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This policy will progressively reduce HFC-134a consumption by 10% each year starting in 2028, with that demand being met by R-600a instead. Over time, this creates a significant shift in the refrigerant mix while maintaining overall service levels.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="creating-the-simulation">
        <h2>Creating the Simulation</h2>

        <p>Now let's create a simulation to compare the policy scenario with our business-as-usual baseline.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Click <strong>Add Simulation</strong></li>
          <li>Name it "GWP Policy"</li>
          <li>Check the <strong>GWP Reduction</strong> policy checkbox</li>
          <li>Set duration from <strong>years 2025 to 2035</strong></li>
          <li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>You should now see both your <strong>BAU</strong> and <strong>GWP Policy</strong> scenarios displayed side by side in the results panel.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>

        <p>Let's examine how the substitution policy affects both substance consumption and climate emissions:</p>

        <p><strong>Substance Consumption Changes</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Select the <strong>Substances</strong> radio button to view individual refrigerant consumption</li>
          <li>Select the <strong>Consumption</strong> radio button to see total consumption volumes</li>
          <li>Compare the <strong>BAU</strong> and <strong>GWP Policy</strong> simulations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You'll observe that starting in 2028, HFC-134a consumption begins declining while R-600a consumption increases correspondingly. The total refrigerant volume (when combined) remains similar between scenarios, but the mix shifts dramatically toward the lower-GWP alternative.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Climate Impact Comparison</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Select the <strong>Emissions</strong> radio button to view climate impact in tCO2e</li>
          <li>Compare the <strong>BAU</strong> and <strong>GWP Policy</strong> simulations</li>
          <li>Notice how overall emissions decrease significantly under the policy scenario</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The climate benefits become apparent immediately: even though total refrigerant consumption stays roughly constant, the overall tCO2e emissions drop substantially. This is because we're replacing a high-GWP substance (1,430 tCO2e/kg) with a very low-GWP alternative (3 tCO2e/kg).
        </p>

        <p><strong>Understanding the GWP Impact</strong></p>
        <p>
          The dramatic emissions reduction demonstrates the power of GWP-focused policies. Each kilogram of HFC-134a replaced with R-600a eliminates approximately 1,427 kg of CO2-equivalent emissions (1,430 - 3 = 1,427). This shows how substance choice can be far more impactful for climate than overall consumption volume reductions.

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>You've successfully modeled a Global Warming Potential-focused refrigerant substitution policy! This tutorial demonstrated:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>GWP significance</strong>: How refrigerant choice dramatically affects climate impact independent of consumption volumes</li>
          <li><strong>Substitution policies</strong>: Using "replace X% of sales with substance" to model gradual market transitions</li>
          <li><strong>Climate effectiveness</strong>: How targeting high-GWP substances can achieve large emissions reductions</li>
          <li><strong>Market realism</strong>: Modeling progressive adoption rather than immediate switching</li>
          <li><strong>Comparative analysis</strong>: Evaluating policy impacts against business-as-usual baselines</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The GWP reduction policy shows how focusing on substance characteristics rather than just consumption volumes can maximize climate benefits. This approach is particularly relevant for Montreal Protocol and Kigali Amendment implementation.
